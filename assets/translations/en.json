That's why, in addition to using algorithms for what they're good at, we have _human beings curate our articles,_ experienced journalists who can provide you with the context you need to understand a complex world.\n\nWe select our articles from sources _with a proven track record_ of following ethical practices and standards in journalism, and we clearly delineate between news, opinion, and analysis.\n\nWhen the publications or authors we curate have a _particularly strong political leanings,_ we mention that political perspective in the editor's note so the reader understands the biases they are encountering.\n\nOn occasion, we may use sources outside the standard realm of journalism, including _blogs and academic articles._ When we do so, we will clearly inform readers in the editor's note and highlight any political affiliations associated with the sources.\n\nOne of our central goals is to _repair a splintered media landscape_ in which people remain in information bubbles, getting news from sources that only reinforce their existing beliefs.\n\nWe therefore believe firmly in providing a common platform where a _variety of perspectives_ can be heard and hope, by doing so, we can help renew civil discourse and counteract ever-greater polarization.\n\nWe do not shy away from engaging with the most hotly discussed topics of the day. However, we seek to _stay above the fray,_ presenting multiple points of view. While _we strive to be non-partisan,_ this does not mean we don't have our own voice or believe there are some limits to acceptable discourse. We will not lend a platform to those who intentionally spread misinformation or question established science. We will exclude sources that peddle propaganda or seek to foment hatred."
